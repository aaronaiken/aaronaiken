Hi there! Iâ€™m Aaron Aiken, and this is my website running on Siteleaf...which is new and exciting for me. This poor site has been on many different platforms, most recently WordPress. I tend to use this domain as a testing ground for platforms and frameworks that look interesting. And Siteleaf certainly looks interesting. 

I digress. 

Here's a bit about me:

* I am married. 
* We have a 3-year-old son who is really fun.
* I am unemployable but have been employed for the last three years.
* I run a website call [Side Internet Business](http://sideinternetbusiness.com).
* I curate a weekly email newsletter called [Freedom Lifestyle Dispatch](http://freedomlifestyledispatch.com). 
* I am a cigar aficionado. 
* I am a coffee snob. 
* I enjoy reading, writing, and traveling.

Thanks for stopping by!
