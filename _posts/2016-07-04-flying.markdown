Inspired once again. This time with flying. 

I was on a track, once, to be a pilot. It was what I always wanted. 

To fly.

I trained. Had an instructor. And completed what is referred to a the "cross country."  A flight, solo, consisting of three different airports and 150 nautical miles.

I was making such good progress. And then I quit. 

God. It was beautiful up there. 

Quiet. 

Smooth. 

Something I would do again. Except now I have a wife and son depending on me. So the risk is much greater. 

But great memories. 

Maybe. 

Maybe one day I will start to fly again.
