Systems 

I am up too late. Drinking wine. Catching up on things in [Reeder](http://reederapp.com). Experimenting with [Airmail](http://airmailapp.com). And thinking about business. And publishing. And life in general. 

The wine is good. 

Reeder is an awesome part of my content curation workflow. And I have decided that I want this site to be published to when the mood strikes. Which will mostly be when I am mobile. 

So I am writing this is [drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/) on my iPhone. Which I will then copy into the mobile web interface of my [Siteleaf](http://www.siteleaf.com) dashboard. And then I'll publish it. 

Which is the way it should be. 

Quick and painless. 

It is all about systems. 

Having the ability to publish whatever, whenever, wherever. 

So here we are. 

To stay.
