So, another late night post. Or, actually, early morning (for me: close to 1 AM EST at this point).

Community. Learning from others. Being around those who have achieve what you want to achieve. That is the major step to success that most (including myself) miss. 

I have not EVER if I am honest, valued to the extent that I do now, the experience and knowledge of others. 

They have done it. They have learned what is necessary to succeed. They have achieved *your* dream. 

The challenge is to find those people and to connect with them. 

I, just this evening, connected with Andy Dew ([@andydew](https://twitter.com/andydew "Andy Dew on Twitter")). And now I’m part of his Mastermind group. And I can’t wait to learn more from him. 

Learning. Step 1. 
Doing. Step 2. 

This will be my second mastermind group that I am apart of (simultaneously). I’m eager to learn from others!
