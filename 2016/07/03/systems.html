<p>Systems</p>

<p>I am up too late. Drinking wine. Catching up on thins in Reeder. Experimenting with Airmail. And thinking about business. And publishing. And life in general.</p>

<p>The wine is good.</p>

<p>Reeder is an awesome part of my content curation workflow. And I have decided that I want this site to be published to when the mood strikes. Which will mostly be when I am mobile.</p>

<p>So I am writing this is drafts on my iPhone. Which I will then copy into the mobile web interface of my Siteleaf dashboard. And then Iâ€™ll publish it.</p>

<p>Which is the way it should be.</p>

<p>Quick and painless.</p>

<p>It is all about systems.</p>

<p>Having the ability to publish whatever, whenever, wherever.</p>

<p>So here we are.</p>

<p>To stay.</p>
