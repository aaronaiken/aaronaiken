<p>So, another late night post. Or, actually, early morning (for me: close to 1 AM EST at this point).</p>

<p>Community. Learning from others. Being around those who have achieve what you want to achieve. That is the major step to success that most (including myself) miss.</p>

<p>I have not EVER if I am honest, valued to the extent that I do now, the experience and knowledge of others.</p>

<p>They have done it. They have learned what is necessary to succeed. They have achieved <em>your</em> dream.</p>

<p>The challenge is to find those people and to connect with them.</p>

<p>I, just this evening, connected with Andy Dew (<a href="https://twitter.com/andydew" title="Andy Dew on Twitter">@andydew</a>). And now I’m part of his Mastermind group. And I can’t wait to learn more from him.</p>

<p>Learning. Step 1. 
Doing. Step 2.</p>

<p>This will be my second mastermind group that I am apart of (simultaneously). I’m eager to learn from others!</p>
